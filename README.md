AI Prediction Oracle for Crypto Prices

Overview

AI Prediction Oracle is a decentralized application (dApp) that leverages AI to provide cryptocurrency price predictions recorded on-chain for transparency. The system integrates a smart contract, an AI model, and a frontend interface to allow users to request and verify price forecasts.

Features

AI-generated cryptocurrency price predictions

Blockchain-based storage for transparency and immutability

Smart contract integration for secure and verifiable transactions

User-friendly frontend for accessing and requesting predictions

API-based AI model integration for real-time forecasts
